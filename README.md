# AOC_2022_PY
Advent of code 2022, in Python.

I am self-learning Python to bolster my skillset. A perfect way to continue my learning is
trying increasingly difficult challenges on a daily basis. Using skills I have learnt
into practice with some obscure and funny problems in a language I am not proficient in.

Once I have solved the challenge, I will seek out a more streamlined and interesting solution
and put this on here for my future reference.
